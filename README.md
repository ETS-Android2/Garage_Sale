<h4>About Garage Sale app</h4>
Garage Sale is an android application consisting of a User and Admin side. User side has two options: Customer and Guest.
 Customers need to be registered users, so they can post ads about future events. Guests will not be registered but they can see the latest offers and events.
 They can reserve an item listed in the garage sales as online trade. The idea is for Customers to be able to post Ads for Garage Sales Ideally.
 Admin has access to manage/monitor the items posted by Customers.
